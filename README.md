## Using hint with external libraries

Our [`config.hs`](packages/hint-demo/config.hs) has access to:

- Internal library, `packages/hint-demo-types`
- External libraries, `optics-core`, `optics-th`, `time`.

We must explicitly define the internal library in [`hint.nix`](nix/modules/flake/hint.nix).

Based on https://github.com/haskell-hint/hint/issues/79

## Running

To run:

```sh
# Nix
nix run

# Cabal
nix develop -c cabal run hint-demo

# ghcid
nix develop -c just run
```
